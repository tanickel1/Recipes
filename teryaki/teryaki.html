    <h1>Steak Teryaki</h1>

        This steak recipie is a great go to during grilling season. 
        You can marinade the streaks in any sauce you want but we love Kikoman Green Onion and Garlic Teriyaki sauce.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Thin cut ribeye</li>
        <li>plain white rice</li>
        <li>Veggies. This goes good with edemame, but green beans work good as well.</li>
        <li>Sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Take the thinly sliced streak, and marinade in the sauce of choice, in the fridge, in a ziplock or bowl.</li>
        <li>While the streak marinades, start your rice, since that takes a long time generally in a rice cooker, or on a stove top.</li>
        <li>When the timer gets to the last few mintes on the rice cooker, start your microwave veggies, and throw your meat on the grill at a high temp, for 3-5 minutes each side, until achieve the proper burn marks, or meat temps.</li>
        <li>Throw the rice in a bowl, and top with veggies, and steak, and sprinkle a little extra sauce to taste.</li>
